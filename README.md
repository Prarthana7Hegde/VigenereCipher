# 🔐 Vigenère Cipher Web Tool

A simple and interactive web-based implementation of the **Vigenère Cipher**, developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project demonstrates classical cryptography techniques used for secure text encryption and decryption.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Encrypt plaintext using a secret key 🔑
- Decrypt cipher text back to the original message
- Preserves spaces, numbers, and special characters
- Case-sensitive encryption (upper/lower letters handled separately)
- Clean, modern, mobile-friendly UI

## 🧠 What is Vigenère Cipher?

The Vigenère Cipher is a classical polyalphabetic substitution cipher that:
- Uses a **repeating key** to shift characters in the message
- Is stronger than Caesar cipher since shifting is not constant

📌 Example:

| Plaintext | HELLO |
|----------|-------|
| Key      | KEYKE |
| Cipher   | RIJVS |

Each letter shift depends on the matching key letter.
